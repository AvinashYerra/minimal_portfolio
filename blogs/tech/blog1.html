    <h1>Choosing a Language & DSA</h1>

  <h1>Language Learning and DSA Preparation Guide</h1>

  <p>When doing DSA, the language doesn't really matter. I started with C++, but people prefer Java because it can also be used in web development. So for syntax practice, people prefer writing in Java.</p>

  <h2>General Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>C++:</strong> Hardware programming</li>
    <li><strong>Java:</strong> Web development</li>
    <li><strong>Python:</strong> Data Analysis, Machine Learning, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>(Use cases can overlap, this is just for a basic idea)</p>

  <p>But for college placements, companies don't really care much about the language you know (C++/Python/Java) because most of the time they hire freshers. What matters is how you approach a problem and frame the solution.</p>

  <p>When we talk about solving sum, count, etc., that's just for your idea. What matters is how much you've learned and how you approach the solution. Chase <strong>quality over quantity</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Language Resources</h2>

  <h3>C++ (Telugu)</h3>
  <p><strong>C++ by Telugu Computer World</strong><br>

 <h3>C++ (English)</h3>
 <p><strong>C++ by BroCode</strong><br>

  <p>If you are in the 1st year, I recommend starting with <strong>C</strong>, because both are quite similar. So complete C and then move to C++ (C is also available from Telugu Computer World).</p>
  
  <p>If you are in the 2nd/3rd/4th year, start directly with the above C++ playlist.</p>

  <h3>Java (English)</h3>

  <h2>DSA Study Plan</h2>
  <p>During the 3rd year internship season or 4th year placement season, if you have some time for coding, start solving the <strong>Striver SDE Sheet (~190 Questions)</strong>:<br>
  Link: <a href="https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/" target="_blank">Striver SDE Sheet</a></p>

  <p>While solving the sheet, make notes of any tricks, logics, or concepts for easier revision later.</p>

  <p>If you have enough time, continue with the <strong>Striver A2Z Sheet (~450 Questions)</strong>:<br>
  Link: <a href="https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/" target="_blank">Striver A2Z Sheet</a></p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is no need to take any paid courses. Everything is available for free on the internet.</p>
